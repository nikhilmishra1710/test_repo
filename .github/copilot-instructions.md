1. On pull requests targeting the main branch, automatically scan for logging.info statements whenever a new commit is pushed or a review is re-requested. Instead of adding comments in the file diff, output only one summary comment in the PR conversation that includes the number of logging.info occurrences found. If any are detected, include a markdown table listing the file names and line numbers; if none are found, post a success message stating the PR is clean. Limit all feedback to this single consolidated comment per trigger event.
